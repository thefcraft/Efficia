# Efficia - AI-Powered Productivity Tracker

Efficia is a comprehensive productivity application designed for Windows users. It helps track computer activity, minimize distractions through smart blocking, manage tasks and goals, take notes, and leverage AI for insights and assistance via a chatbot interface.

This project aims to provide a robust system for monitoring user activity and offering tools to enhance focus and efficiency. It integrates database management, background services, machine learning models, and a web-based frontend for user interaction and data visualization.

This project particularly demonstrates database design for activity logging, hierarchical data storage (chatbots, todos), and relational data modeling for productivity features.

## TODO
- [ ] REMOVE API KEYS
- [ ] Add Multiple MCP Server for task like gmail, google search etc etc
- [ ] Use Langchain for the above
- [ ] Voice part is computationally expensive so search solutions
- [ ] Improve the Classification Part (maybe by custom embedding based classification)
- [ ] fix full window detection (for multiple screens/monitor)
- [ ] TF/DF: The agent part is missing implementation
- [ ] Fix Ui/Ux and backend connection and api is missing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python (Check `.python-version` or `pyproject.toml` for specific version, e.g., 3.10+)
*   `uv` (Python package manager - `pip install uv`)
*   Node.js and Bun (`npm install -g bun`)
*   Git
*   Windows Operating System (for the background service)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thefcraft/Efficia.git
    cd Efficia
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python dependencies using uv
    uv sync

    # Set up environment variables
    cp .env.example .env # Create .env if an example exists, otherwise create manually
    # Edit .env and add your API keys (e.g., GROQ_API_KEY)
    # !! IMPORTANT: Ensure .env is listed in your .gitignore file !!
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    bun install
    # bun run build # Optional: build for production
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Database Setup:**
    ```bash
    # The database file (`instance/database.db`) will be created automatically.
    # Run migrations if necessary:
    python run_migration.py
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

You need to run multiple components simultaneously. Open separate terminal windows for each.

1.  **Start the Backend API:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure your virtual environment is activated
    python run_api.py
    # Or: uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000 (adjust host/port if needed)
    ```
    The API will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the Background Service (on Windows):**
    ```bash
    # Make sure your virtual environment is activated
    python run_service.py
    ```
    This service will start tracking your activity and sending data to the API.

3.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    bun run dev
    ```
    The frontend will usually be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port specified by Vite).

*(Note: For production, you would build the frontend (`bun run build`) and serve the static files, potentially using the FastAPI backend itself or a dedicated web server like Nginx.)*

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

*   **Type:** SQLite
*   **Location:** The database file (`database.db`) is stored in the `instance/` directory, which should be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
*   **Schema:** Defined in `db/models.py`.
*   **Migrations:** Database schema changes are managed via scripts in `db/migrate/`. Run `python run_migration.py` to apply pending migrations.
